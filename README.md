My attempt at completing the exercises within Brian Kernighan's "The C Programming Language"

Exercise 1-20: Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns.  Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

Exercise 1-21: Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab.  When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be give preference?

Exercise 1-22: Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.

Exercise 1-23: Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments do not nest.
